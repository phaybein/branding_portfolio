          Who knew that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were a great way to
          show Color Theory. Developers looking for some help regarding color
          theory for design then this is for you. Understanding color theory is
          a significant role for developers and this video makes the concepts
          straightforward for us to understand and also remember. Every time you
          see the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles you will now think of color
          theory. Who knew that color theory psychology was so embedded in the
          Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and why they worked so well together.
